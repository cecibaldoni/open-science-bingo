# SORTEE Open Science Bingo

The SORTEE Open Science Bingo is a community-driven initiative designed to encourage, track, and celebrate the adoption of high-impact practices in transparent and reproducible research, particularly within the fields of Ecology, Evolution, and related disciplines.

This repository hosts the canonical list of potential Open Science statements and the source code for generating the Bingo cards.

## Why Play?

Open Science is not an all-or-nothing endeavour. This Bingo serves as a fun, low-pressure tool to:

1. Acknowledge the Open Science practices **you have already successfully implemented**.
2. Identify high-value practices **you want to adopt** in your next project.
3. Engage with the **SORTEE community** on best practices in reproducible research.
